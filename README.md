End-END machine learning classification project

● Developed a Credit Risk ClassificaAon Model: Built a machine learning model to classify bank customers into 4 risk levels (P0, P1, P2, P3) based on their credit history, leveraging a real-world ICICI Bank dataset.
● Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Utilized Pandas for data cleaning, performed Sequential VIF-based feature selection, reducing dimensionality from 64 to 39 features, and mitigated multicollinearity to prevent overfitting.
● Modeling & Hyperparameter Tuning: Applied CatBoost to train the model, optimized performance through hyperparameter tuning, and tracked experiments using MLflow, achieving 78.39% accuracy on unseen data.
● Deployment & Automation: Developed a Streamlit front-end for model interaction, containerized the application with Docker, and automated build and deployment using GitHub Actions and Docker Hub for streamlined CI/CD.
